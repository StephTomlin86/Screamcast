## Usage

This application requires users to create a user account and utilizes password hashing and authentication. There are two categories of movie lists a user can see: "Spooky" movies based on user ratings, and Halloween movies based on their general themes. Users can view details of individual movies, the average spooky rating, anonymous reviews from other users, as well as leave their own.
